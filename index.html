<h1 style="text-align: center;"> Navient Lawsuits Are Disproportionately Filed in the South </h1>
<p style="text-align: right"> By: Jon Donville </p>

<p> As the cost of college tuition has risen steadily over the 35 years, more and more Americans have had to contend with student loans. One of the largest student loan servicers, Navient Corporation, was hit with a series of lawsuits beginning in 2017, which include lawsuits from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The lawsuits accuse Navient of a number of actions that negatively affect their customers, including failing “to correctly apply or allocate borrower student loan payments to their accounts,” steering “struggling borrowers toward multiple forbearances,” and deceiving “private student loan borrowers about cosigner release requirements” (studentloanplanner.com). </p>

<p>
	The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau publishes state by state statistics which show where Navient lawsuits are filed around the country. The results show a consistent pattern, which is that Navient lawsuits are disproportionately filed in the South. Using the regions provided by the US Census bureau, the South consists of West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas and Oklahoma. 
</p>

<p>
	In total numbers, the South has way more lawsuits over the past three years than the other states.

<p> But even when adjusted on a per capita basis, the South is still way higher in terms of the number of lawsuits filed. </p>

<p> Georgia led all states with 7.31 cases per 1,000 people, tied with only DC. Florida came just behind Georgia, with 6.96 cases per 1,000 people. According to the Census Bureau, the South has the lowest median household income in the country, which is likely a reason why there are so many lawsuits filed there. Less income means more people taking loans, which leads to more lawsuits against the loan companies. </p>
